Starting off as a self-education project @CodeGorilla Bootcamp.
Scrabble based word game app. More to come as project progresses.

Clone project and run npm install and npm start.
Uses react-dnd for drag and drop funcionality.

The user can drag and drop characters to form words. 
The app indicates if the string starts with a valid word and gives feedback.
Button state changes. Playing a word is not possible yet.

Known bug: wildcard letter disappears when dropping on itself.
